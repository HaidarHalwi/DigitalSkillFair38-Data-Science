ðŸš¢ Titanic Data Analysis â€“ Final Project
This repository contains my final project for the Data Science & Machine Learning program at dibimbing.id, where I explored and analyzed the Titanic dataset to uncover insights on survival patterns.

ðŸ“Š Project Objectives:
- Explore the structure and quality of the Titanic dataset
- Clean and preprocess data (handle duplicates & missing values)
- Perform statistical summaries and visualizations
- Generate insights that can inform future machine learning applications

ðŸ”§ Tools & Environment:
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook in the cloud)
- Microsoft Excel (initial dataset format)

ðŸ“š Libraries Used:
- pandas â€“ for data manipulation
- numpy â€“ for numerical operations
- matplotlib & seaborn â€“ for data visualization

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
Dataset: titanic.xlsx
Columns used: Survived, Name, Sex, Age

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:
- Data exploration using head(), tail(), sample(), and info()
- Statistical summary with describe() and visual interpretation
- Duplicate handling and missing value treatment (using median)
- Insight generation from gender, age, and survival patterns
- Well-commented and clean code ready for further ML modeling

ðŸ§  Insight:
Although machine learning algorithms were not applied in this stage, the cleaned and well-structured dataset makes it highly suitable for the next steps in predictive modeling.
